         <ul>
           <li> <b>1935</b>
               -Roy P. Benavidez was born in Lindenau near Cuero, Texas in DeWitt County. 
           </li><br>
           <li> <strong>1937</strong>
               -When he was two years old, his father died of tuberculosis and his mother remarried. Five years later, his mother died from tuberculosis as well. Benavidez and his younger brother Roger moved to El Campo, where their grandfather, uncle and aunt raised them along with eight cousins.
           </li><br>
           <li> <strong>1950</strong>
             -At the age of 15 he dropped out of school in order to work full-time to help support the family.
           </li><br>
           <li> <strong>1952</strong>
             -At the age of 17 Benavidez enlisted in the Texas Army National Guard. He was sent to Korea to pull security duty in the demilitarized zone after the Korean War had ended, and then he was sent to Germany, Benavidez dreamed of earning his jump wings and finally got the opportunity after being assigned as General William Westmoreland’s driver. After completing Airborne training, he was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
           </li><br>
           <li> <strong>1955</strong>
             -In June he switched from the Army National Guard to Army active duty.
           </li><br>
           <li> <strong>1959</strong>
             -He married Hilaria Coy Benavidez, completed Airborne training, and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and began training for the elite Army Special Forces. Once qualified and accepted, he became a member of the 5th Special Forces Group; and the Studies and Observations Group (SOG).
           </li><br>
           <li> <strong>1964</strong>
             -In October Benavidez was among the first 125,000 American troops in Vietnam. Working as a military advisory alongside Republic of Vietnam soldiers, he helped train them in American military tactics. One day, while on patrol, he stepped on and triggered a land mine.He was evacuated to the United States to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas 
           </li><br>
           <li> <strong>1964-1968</strong>
             -The blast wiped his memory clean, and the paralyzation that ensued made even the simplest movements painful or impossible. He was told he would never walk again. He begged the doctor not to release him from the military, to just give him a little more time to recover. He took matters into his own hands and began to crawl and slowly rebuilt his strenghth back. He quietly devised a plan to join the ranks of the Army’s new elite unit: the Special Forces. Over the next year, he rebuilt his body and mind by working out consistently and studying the field manuals that were taught in the Special Warfare School. In order to get himself back on jump status, he used his knowledge of the Army’s bureaucracy to get himself into a perfectly good airplane to jump out of.He submitted his paperwork and was admitted into Special Forces selection. Though the training and workload was extremely tough, he earned the coveted Green Beret.
           </li><br>
           <li> <strong>1968</strong>
             - Upon returning to Veitnam, On May 2, 1968, he was off duty and listening to a sermon from the chaplain when he overhead some radio chatter and walked over to the communications stations to see what was going on. A 12-man Special Forces patrol, comprised of three Green Berets and nine Montagnard tribesmen had been surrounded by over 1,000 North Vietnamese infantry. All 12 of the men had suffered serious injuries. Benavidez ran to the helipad to greet the bullet-ridden helicopters that had failed to extract the soldiers. The door gunner, Specialist 4 Michael Craigs, had been shot several times and fell into Benavidez’s arms. “Oh my god, my mother and father,” were the 19-year-old’s last words. Without time to go get his rifle, Benavidez boarded a different returning helicopter armed only with his knife and a medical bag — he knew there would be weapons on the ground to use once he got there.<p> All the knowledge he had accrued throughout his rough life and challenging military career kicked in. He descended into the pits of hell for six hours. Exposeing himself constantly to withering enemy fire, and his refusal to be stopped despite numerous severe wounds, saved the lives of at least eight men. At one point in the battle an NVA soldier accosted him and stabbed him with his bayonet. Benavidez pulled it out, yanked out his own knife, killed him and kept going, leaving his knife in the NVA soldier's body. After the battle, he was evacuated to the base camp, examined, and thought to be dead. As he was placed in a body bag among the other dead in body bags, he was suddenly recognized by a friend who called for help. A doctor came and examined him but believed Benavidez was dead. The doctor was about to zip up the body bag when Benavidez managed to spit in his face, alerting the doctor that he was alive. Benavidez had a total of 37 separate bullet, bayonet, and shrapnel wounds from the six-hour fight with the enemy battalion.</p>

           </li><br>
